                <section><h1>Another Date, Another Time</h1><p>Consider the following problem: you want to generate your own blog HTML and would like to sort your posts by date and display the five most recent on your main page. On top of that, imagine you're not loving the coffee at work as much as you used to. These are my immediate problems and to solve them I'll have to get more comfortable with the Date object and Time element. Also, I will have to rethink my whole coffee situation.</p><h2>My First Date()</h2><p>When seeking to broaden my programming skills I was directed to check out Node School, the Node.js community training page. Near the end of the very well put-together "learn-you-node" workshopper, you are tasked to create time stamps for packets received using the javascript Date object. A quick look to the MDN Date page later and I was able to complete the exercise, pass the course, quit my job, and move to Sweden.</p><p>Unlikely.</p><p>Actually, there was much confusion, command-tabbing, and stress-snacking. However, now, a year or so later, I think I understand how the Date object works and, more importantly, WHY the Date object was so difficult to approach.</p><h2>Know the State of your Date</h2><p>The main problem I had, and still have, is knowing what state my date information actually is in.</p><p>...And that's enough. To cover this adequately I'll need to detect code snippets and maybe have some syntax highlighting. </p><p>To be continued...</p></section>
