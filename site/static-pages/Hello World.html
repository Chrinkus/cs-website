                <h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is some filler post content for parsing. i should probably mention that I've never done this before and am really excited to parse what I'm writing and have it actually work. I'm less excited to parse this a few dozen times before it does work but meh, nothing worth something was ever anything so.. yeah.</p><h2>Moving on..</h2><p>Second verse, mostly more drivel. The idea is to put these text sections into a paragraph node and the titles into headings. Obviously. However, I'm not sure if I can only use one h1 per page or if nested sections can start their own heading heierarchy. I guess I'll find out.</p><h2>Don't forget!</h2><p>I'll also need a replacer to substitute such html unfriendly characters as & and <>'s.</p>
